# DataAnalyzer

DataAnalyzer is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the process of data analysis for both small and large datasets. It provides a streamlined interface to analyze, visualize, and interpret data efficiently. The tool leverages powerful Python libraries to offer a comprehensive suite of features for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Importing**: Easily import data from various formats, including CSV, Excel, and JSON.
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically detect and handle missing values, duplicate records, and outliers.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Perform descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate a wide range of plots and charts to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Tailor the analysis process to specific needs with customizable functions and parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to be intuitive and easy to use for both beginners and experienced data analysts.

## Getting Started

To get started with DataAnalyzer, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. 

### Usage

Simply import the `analyzer.py` module and use the provided functions to start analyzing your data.

```python
from analyzer import DataAnalyzer

# Example usage
analyzer = DataAnalyzer("data.csv")
analyzer.clean_data()
analyzer.perform_statistical_analysis()
analyzer.visualize_data()
```

## Dependencies
